## Bulls and Cows Game

This is a starter project to get familiar with C++ and a small part of unreal standards (which is why you will see the int32' and FString's in there). Not really a complicated project. More so here so that when I am showing my game during an E3 conference in 10 years, people can link back to this project as the first "game" I made.
